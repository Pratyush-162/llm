This notebook demonstrates how to use the LayoutPDFReader to parse PDF documents while preserving their hierarchical layout information. 
This tool is particularly useful for tasks like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications where maintaining the structure of the document (
e.g., sections, paragraphs, tables) is crucial.
This notebook demonstrates how to use LayoutPDFReader to parse PDFs while preserving their layout structure, enabling more effective text chunking and analysis for LLM applications. You can use this tool to extract sections, analyze tables, and perform vector search with smart chunking.
